For this homework, there is no starter file. You have to create your own .py file and submit it to Autolab. You can take a previous starter file and modify it appropriately.
<br /><br /> 

  <li> Please add your name, Andrew id, and section at the top of the file.
  <li> Write test functions for each function you write. </li>
  <li> APPLY TOP-DOWN DESIGN, USE LOTS OF HELPER FUNCTIONS. </li>
  <li> IMPORTANT: Make sure you put all test functions and manually graded functions below #ignore_rest. </li>
  <li> You will be graded on style. You can lose up to 10 poins for style (out of 100 points). Please see <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/notes-style.html" target="_blank">here</a> for the style rubric.</li>
  <li> You may not use recursion, sets, dictionaries or any other constructs that we have not yet covered in class.</li>
  <li> You will have 5 submissions on Autolab for this homework. </li>


  <h3> Questions </h3>

  <h4> 1. The Memory game [100 pts] </h4>
  <p>
  In this game, a (rows x cols) rectangular grid is filled with random numbers such that each integer from 1 to (rows * cols)/2 occurs exactly twice. If (rows * cols) is an odd number, then use the integers from 1 to floor((rows*cols)/2) and let the remaining card be empty. So for example, if I have rows = 3 and cols = 5, then I would use the numbers 1-7 twice each (which would give a total of 14 cards) and just have one additional card in the board which is empty (for a total of 3 * 5 = 15 cards).</p>
  <p> 
  The numbers in the board are originally hidden. On each turn, the player uncovers two numbers by specifying a row and a column for the cards they wish to uncover. If the numbers in these cards match, they are unhidden (so the player can see them). Play ends when all the numbers are unhidden. The score depends on the number of incorrect guesses, with the player incurring -1 pt for incorrect guesses and 5 pt for correct guesses. At the end of each turn, the score is displayed to the user. </p>

  <p>
  With this in mind, write the function playMemoryGame(rows, cols) that implements this game as described. Follow this spec when you can, but there are also a lot of decisions left up to you. For example, when asking the user for the two cards they wish to uncover, you can ask the user to input the two choices at once separating them with a comma,or you could prompt the user twice, so they can input each row-col location for the card separately. </p>

  <p>
  In any case, make your game playable, though we understand that console-based games have their limitations. Also, include a ‘help’ command that explains how to enter commands. Note: we will only test this up to 26x26 grids (so you don't have to deal with column AA...). </p>

  Below are two screenshots of a Memory Game we implemented to give you more of an idea of how this game should look.

  <!--<br />
  <li>
  Do question 4 from <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/hw4.html" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
  Note that the input to the function is 3 lists so the length/size of the input is the sum of the lengths of these lists. There are two ways to approach this problem. One is a polynomial-time algorithm, which is the solution you should be implementing. The other is an exponential time algorithm and is actually harder to implement. Before you start coding, think carefully about your approach and make sure you are using the polynomial-time approach. In fact, you are encouraged to discuss your approach with a course staff before you start typing code.
