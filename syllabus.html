      <p>
        Welcome to 15-112! This course introduces students to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. It is intended
        for students with little or no background in programming. Even so, it is a fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122. Students looking for a gentler introduction to computer science concepts should consider taking 15-110 first.
      </p>

      <p>
        A computer program is simply a set of instructions that tells a computer to perform a task. However, finding the right set of instructions can be quite challenging. For this, one has to learn how to structure a larger problem into small subsets, and then
        find the solution to each of those subsets. A big part of this course is dedicated to teaching students a way of thinking that will enable them to build non-trivial programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like human-understanble instructions can be given in various human languages, computer-understandable instructions can be given in various <i>programming languages</i>. There can be important differences between programming languages, but
        many of them use the same building blocks that are fundamental to programming. Once you learn a programming language, it becomes much easier to learn another language. This course uses the <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>        programming language.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

      <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'>Develop computational problem-solving skills using Python as a tool to be applied to new problems, especially in the student's home academic discipline.</li>
      <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'>Produce clear, robust, and efficient code in Python by employing top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging techniques.</li>
      <li>Apply programming-style conventions to make the programs easy to understand, debug and modify.</li>
      <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'>Learn independently about new programming-language features and libraries/modules by reading documentation and by experimenting.</li>
      <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'>Develop and write a substantial (700-1500 line) program in Python to implement a solution to a term project of their choosing during the last week of classes.</li>

      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        None.
      </p>

      <h3>Required Software</h3> Every required software package we use is available for free on the web. This includes:
      <li> Python <strong> version 3.x (3.4 or later) </strong>, which can be freely downloaded from python.org.</li>
      <li> We may also use Brython, which is a version of Python that runs in web browsers.</li>
      <li> We will also use one or more free IDE's (code editors) and other free software packages.</li>

      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        There is no required text for the course. Lecture notes will be provided on the course website. We will frequently use notes from the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/index.html" target="_blank">Spring 2017 edition</a> of the course, which
        contain very useful examples and videos!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to look at books which contain part of the course material, we recommend the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        <li><a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html" target="_blank">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a> (interactive online textbook)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282418/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1462645119&sr=8-9&keywords=python" target="_blank">Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</a> (regular textbook)</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any Python specific questions, the first place you should look at is the official Python documentation:
      </p>
      <li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/index.html" target="_blank">Python 3.5.1 documentation</a></li>
      <p>
        Information you find above is guaranteed to be correct. The same cannot be said of information you might find on, say, Stack Overflow. Be careful about googling concepts related to a homework question as this may violate academic integrity (see the section
        on academic integrity below). You are, however, always welcome to (and encouraged to (!)) use the official Python documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication with the Course Staff</h3>
      <p>
        Every student is <strong>required</strong> to signup for the course's Piazza page! Course related announcements will be made using Piazza, so you must check Piazza every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a question regarding the lecture material or a homework question, please make use of the following resources:
      </p>
      <li> <i>Piazza</i>: Piazza is best suited for questions with a short answer. </li>
      <li> <i>Office hours</i>: Questions that require a back and forth conversation is much better suited for office hours.
        <p>
          For personal matters, you can directly email the course instructor (rmorina).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a grading related question, please contact the head TA (nle).
        </p>


        <h3>Grading</h3> Your grade for the course will be calculated according to the following table.
        <p align="center">
          <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Course Component</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Weight</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </table>
        </p>


        <h4>Homework</h4>
        <p>
          There will be multiple homework assignments every week for the first 5 weeks. There will be 2 (or possibly 3) small assignments due during the week, and 1 larger assignment due during the weekend. It is important that you complete all assignments, as
          this is the major way in which you will learn the material. By working hard on the assignments, you will gain essential experience needed to solve problems on the exams and create term projects that you can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all homework must be done by yourself without collaborating with anyone else. You are of course welcome to (and encouraged to (!)) ask questions to the course staff in office hours or Piazza.
        </p>
        <p><i><b>Submission:</b></i> Assignment submissions will take place on Autolab. Every student is responsible for verifying that their submissions are successful. Misformatted homework in general cannot be graded by our autograder, and as such may
          receive 0 points. Thus, be sure to submit your homework early -- you can submit repeatedly, but we only grade the last submission.In recitation, we will walk you through how to submit your work on Autolab.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i><b>Late Policy:</b></i> You are allowed 2 free (no penalty) late days for the course. (These are also called grace days.) You can use at most 1 grace day for an assignment. The late days cannot be broken down further, i.e., even if you submit
          5 minutes late, it will count as 1 late day. Once you submit a day late, one of your grace days will be automatically deducted by Autolab. You do not have to notify us. After you have used up all of your late days, late submissions will not
          be accepted and will result in 0% for that assignment. Exceptions to the lateness policy will not be granted without appropriate justification (e.g. medical or family emergency) submitted in writing and supported by documentary evidence.
        </p>

        <h4>Exams</h4>
        <p>
          We will have 2 exams during the semester (June 12th and June 26th). Both will be held in lecture and they will be cumulative. More information will be provided before the exams.
        </p>

        <h4>Quizzes</h4> We will have 5 quizzes during the semester (May 26th, June 2nd, June 9th, June 16th, June 23rd). All will be held in Friday recitations. The quizzes will help you prepare for the homework and the exams.

        <h4>Term Project</h4> An important component of the course is the term project. The last week of the course will be entirely devoted to working on your term projects. You will have the freedom to create any program you want! This will be a great way to display all
        of the programming skills and knowledge you have learned in the course. We hope that you will work on a project that you really find interesting, that you'll have fun working on, and that you'll be proud of at the end.

        <h4>Participation</h4> You are expected to attend every lecture and recitation unless you have special permission from the instructor. Attendance will be taken and will be used to calculate your participation grade.

        <h3>Classroom</h3>
        <h4>Recording</h4> Students may not record lectures or recitations without explicit permission in writing from the instructor. Violations will result in your failing the course. Exceptions will be granted in accordance with university guidelines for accessibility
        concerns, but even then such recordings may not be shared publicly or privately and must be deleted at the end of the semester.

        <h4>Electronics</h4>
        <p>Students may not use any electronic devices in lecture (no cell phones, laptops, iPads, iPods, iWhatevers, etc) without explicit permission in writing from the instructor. Students are expected to take notes, but to do so manually (pen and paper).
        </p>

        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3> We understand that most of you would never consider cheating in any form. There is, however, a small minority of students for whom this is not the case. In the past, when we have caught students cheating they have often insisted that they did
        not understand the rules and penalties. As a part of the first homework, you will be required to acknowledge that you have read and understood the cheating policies. Please read <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm"
          target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University Policy on Academic Integrity</a>. The following are some clear examples of cheating:
        <p>
          <li>Looking at another student's paper during an exam or a quiz.</li>
          <li>Submitting code that does not belong to you without properly citing your sources.</li>
          <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'> Looking at a piece of code related to a homework problem that you have not written yourself or that is not published by the course staff. Specifically: <strong>do not look at other students' code or written answers, and do not show them your code or written answers, until after the assignment deadline has passed and the assignment has been submitted and graded. </strong>
          </li>
          <li style='padding-left: 2em;text-indent: -2em'>Showing to someone else a piece of code related to a homework problem that is not published by the course. Specifically <strong> do not email or otherwise electronically or physically transfer your code to other students, and do not receive such transmissions from other students, until after the assignment deadline has passed and the assignment has been submitted and graded.</strong>            </li>
          <li>Googling for specific keywords that happen to appear in one of the homework questions.</li>
          <li>Getting help from someone who is not part of the course staff. </li>
          <li>Receiving exam related information from a student who has already taken the exam when you have not.</li>
          <li>Attempting to hack any part of the 15-112 infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Lying to the course staff.</li>
        </p>

        <h4>Online "Help"</h4> There are many online 'help' resources, and while some may be legitimate, many are basically providing a homework outsourcing service, or otherwise violating the spirit (and often also the letter) of our course policies on cheating and collaboration.
        Importantly, we also cannot control the quality of 'help' students receive from such sources, and experience indicates many 'answers' from such sources are of very low quality (presumably in part as these are not always supplied by CMU Teaching
        Assistants or other similarly-qualified tutors). Finally, given the truly extensive support this course provides through daily office hours, private and small-group tutoring, email-based help, and so forth, not to mention the support of the broader
        CMU community of learners, there is no compelling reason students should need any external sources (except, presumably, to obtain assistance in violation of course policies). AND SO... <strong> Students may not post any course content, nor any questions related to any assigned material, to any online venue. Doing so may result in failing the course on the first offense. </strong>

        <h4>Retaking Course / Reusing Prior Material Policy</h4>
        <p> If you are repeating 112, your prior work in this course is treated just as anyone else's work -- that is, you may not consult it. This is to promote the best possible learning, and using your prior answers will only hurt in that regard. So do
          not refer to your prior work, and solve everything from scratch. This will result in your best learning experience. </p>

        <h4>Consequences</h4> The penalty for cheating can range from a 10% deduction on your overall course average (i.e. a letter grade drop) to directly failing the course. Furthermore, a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs is sent and further consequences are determined
        by them.

        <h3>Plagiarism Detection</h3>

        <p>
          We will be using automated software similarity detection tools to compare your assignment submissions to that of all other students who are currently taking the course and who have taken the course in the past. These tools are very effective at what they
          have been designed for. For a demonstration, please watch how it works (<a href="media/automated-plagiarism-detector-demo.avi" target="_blank">avi</a> or <a href="media/automated-plagiarism-detector-demo.mp4" target="_blank">mp4</a>).
          Note that the main use of these tools is to determine which submissions should be manually checked for similarity by the instructor; we will not accuse anyone of copying or working in groups based solely on the output of these tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also be asked to present and explain your assignment submissions to the instructor at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>Extended-Time and Make-Up Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We are happy to accomodate students that require extended time approved by Larry Powell's office. Please contact the instructor if you are in this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be no make-up quizzes, exams, or homeworks, except in the case of documented medical or family emergencies, or other university approved absences. The common cold or your computer crashing do not qualify as an excused absence. Keep in mind
          that you have 2 free late days for the homework. You should save up your free late days for when you really need it, e.g., when your computer crashes.
        </p>

        <h3>Well-being and Happiness</h3>
        <p>
          We very much care about your well-being and happiness! Be aware that everyone on the course staff is always available to provide counsel or chat, and you should attend office hours as often as you want for academic and non-academic conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, also know that the university provides services that you may want to take advantage of at some point during the semester. Over the summer some resources from the regular semester may be limited or non-existent. If you are ever unsure about them,
          run into a problem, or want more information, feel free to reach out to the instructor.
        </p>

        <h4>CMU Police Department</h4> Do not hesitate to call CMU police when in an emergency or if you are interested in taking advantage of their services.

        <h4>Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</h4> CAPS has a more limited staff during the summer but is still available for you to use. They offer therapy, crisis support, etc. and you should reach out to CAPS for counseling if you are struggling, no matter how small you may think your problems
        are. If CAPS can’t help you appropriately, they also do referrals and basic consultations to help you find what you need.
